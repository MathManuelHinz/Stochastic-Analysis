	These are unofficial lecture notes written by a student. They are messy, will almost surely contain 
    errors, typos and misunderstandings and may not be kept up to date! I do however try my best and use 
    these notes to prepare for my exams. Feel free to email me any corrections to mh@mssh.dev or s6mlhinz@uni-bonn.de.

    Happy learning!
